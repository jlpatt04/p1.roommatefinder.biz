<p> My name is Jennifer Patten. Most people call me Jen.  I'm from upstate New York. 
No, it's not even close to NYC. Port Henry is a small town you have never heard of. Situated in 
in the Adirondack Mountains, it's a place of relaxation and nature.</p>

<p> I studied Economics and Spanish at St. Lawrence University. I wish I 
would have taken a computer science course, but I didn't know very much about
computer programming at that time. I also didn't have one friend who studied
programming. Who would think 8 years later I'm really enjoying programing? After six months 
of dabbling in control structures and loops, I'm starting to understand how I can use programming 
concepts to build something beautiful.</p>

<p> What do I do for fun? Well I've been very busy lately with preparing
for my classes and learning, but I'm looking forward to doing a little
skiing this winter. I also enjoy being active and cooking different cuisines. My favorites are 
Indian, Mexican, Ethiopian,  and Asian(Sushi). I love anything spicy and flavorful! </p>

<p> Thanks for reading and I'm looking forward to building a "Dynamic Web 
Application"! </p>
