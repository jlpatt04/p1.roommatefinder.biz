<p>My name is Jennifer Patten. Most people call me Jen.  I'm from upstate New York. 
No, it's not even close to NYC. Port Henry is a small town located 6 hours north of NYC that
you have never heard of. It is located in the Adirondack Mountains and on Lake Champlain. 
Even though I grew up in rural upstate NY; I consider Boston my home. </p>

<p>In regards to my studies, I focused on Economics and Spanish at St. Lawrence University. I wish I 
would have taken a computer science course, but I didn't know very much about
computer programming at that time. I also didn't have one friend who studied
programming. Who would think 8 years later I'm really enjoying programing? After six months 
of dabbling in control structures,loops and variables, I'm starting to understand how I 
can use programming concepts to build something beautiful.</p>

<p>What do I do for fun? I enjoy reading and staying up to date with current events. I recently finished "Dreams from my Father" and "A 
Reason to Believe". Barrack Obama and Deval Patrick's biographies inspire me not only to do 
great things in my life, but to give back to society and make an impact in my corner of the world.
On a lighter note, I really enjoy skiing in the winter. It's such an exhilarating sport. Additionally,
I enjoy cooking different cuisines. My favorites are Indian, Mexican, Ethiopian, and Asian(Sushi).
I love anything spicy and/or flavorful! </p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I'm looking forward to building a "Dynamic Web 
Application"! </p>

<p> PS I'm using TextWrangler :) </p>
