<p> My name is Jennifer Patten. Most people call me Jen, but my professional
name is Jennifer. I'm from upstate New York. No, it's not even close to 
NYC. Port Henry is a small town you have never heard of. </p>

<p> I studied Economics and Spanish at St. Lawrence University. I wish I 
would have taken a computer science course, but I didn't know very much about
computer programming or knew anyone that knew how to program. Who would know
8 years later I'm really enjoying programing? After a year of dabbling in control 
structures and loops, I'm starting to understand how I can use programming 
concepts to build something beautiful.</p>

<p> What do I do for fun? Well I've been very busy lately with preparing
for my classes and learning, but I'm looking forward to doing a little
skiing this winter. I also enjoy being active and cooking different cuisines.
I love anything spicy! </p>

<p> Thanks for reading and I'm looking forward to building a "Dynamic Web 
Application"! </p>
